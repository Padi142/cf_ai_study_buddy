I need a slick way of showing the user what is on their calendar. This app allows the user to interact with a chat window and schedule events in their calendar. The calendar entry is defined in the @types/calendar.ts file. I want to have both the chat window and the calendar on the same page.

- use shadcn components
- match the visual style of other components in the app
- focus on great UX and making it beautiful
